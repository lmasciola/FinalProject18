# Intro to Programming Final Project - "Sherlock: A Study in Pink"
## Description
This game based off of the BBC Sherlock episode "A Study in Pink." However, the player does not simply see what happens in the episode. They are able to experience it because they play as the infamous detective, Sherlock Holmes! In this game, players will discover clues and eventually decide who they believe is the culprit in this story. This is a fairly straightforward, text-based game where the user will make different decisions that will affect the outcome of the game (Be careful how you treat Lestrade! He's instrumental in completing the game). There are several ways the game can end, most of which are failing, but that's okay! The player can always restart the game and try again!
